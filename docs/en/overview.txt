Overview
=====

`RESTAS`_ is a framework for development of web-application with Common Lisp
language. Its key features are:

* `RESTAS`_ was developed to simplify development of web applications,
following `REST`_ architecture style.

* RESTAS is based on `Hunchentoot`_. Despite of that web application development
  with RESTAS is in many aspects simplier, than with `Hunchentoot`_,
  knowledge of `Hunchentoot`_ is required, at least about working with 
  :var:`hunchentoot:*request*` and :var:`hunchentoot:*reply*`.

* Request dispatch is based on route system. Route system is key concept of
  `RESTAS`_ and in this area it provides opportunities having no counterparts
  in other web frameworks.

* Mechanics of reusing code with module system is other key concept. It
  provides flexible way for design reuse of modules with maximal simplisity
  of their development.
  
* Full support of interactive development. Any code concernig RESTAS (such as
  definition of route, module or submodule) can be recompiled at any time
  when you work in `SLIME`_ and any changes you made can be immediatly seen in
  your browser. No webserver restart or other complicated actions are needed.

* `SLIME`_ integration. Now it mainly lets investigate inner structure of web
  applications with standard "SLIME Inspector". For example, there is a
  "site map" and a simple code navigation with it.

* Easy to use, pure Lisp web application demonization facility based on
  `RESTAS`_ and `SBCL`_ in Linux without usage of `Screen`_ or `detachtty`_,
  which are traditional solutions of this problem and create tonns of promlebs
  when intensively used.

* RESTAS is not a MVC famework, though it doesn't contradict the concept.
  From MVC point of view, `RESTAS`_ provides the level of controller. Nevertheless,
  `RESTAS`_ provides effective and flexible way for separation of logic and
  representation, because it doesn't put any constraints on structure of
  developed applications. Separation of model and controller can be effectively
  performed with Common Lisp facilities, and, hence, doesn't need any special
  support from the framework.

* RESTAS doesn't contain a template library. Though, we recomend using one when
  you develop a real web application. The Author recommends `cl-closure-template`_.
  Other well-known template libraty is `HTML-TEMPLATE`_.

`RESTAS`_ is distributed under the terms of `Lisp LGPL`_ license.
